The AMRIT Helpline104 service aims to provide comprehensive assistance to individuals in need. It offers a range of services such as medical advice, counseling, grievance resolution, and support during health emergencies. The helpline is designed to cater to the specific needs of callers, ensuring they receive the appropriate assistance.

## Features

- **Medical Advice**: Callers can receive medical advice from trained professionals through the helpline. The service provides guidance and recommendations based on the caller's health concerns.

- **Counseling**: The helpline offers counseling services to individuals who require emotional support. Trained professionals are available to provide guidance and help callers cope with various challenges.

- **Grievance Resolution**: Callers can raise general grievances, which are then tracked using a unique Grievance ID. This ensures that concerns are properly addressed and resolved in a timely manner.

- **Directory Service**: The helpline provides a directory service to help callers locate relevant healthcare facilities, doctors, and other medical resources. This feature assists individuals in finding the appropriate assistance they need.

     ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - From the project root directory, run:
     ```
     npm ci
     ```
   - This will install all required dependencies including Husky and commitlint

3. **Verify hooks installation**
   - The hooks should be automatically installed by Husky
   - You can verify by checking if the `.husky` directory contains executable hooks
